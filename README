Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ScpDeploy
------------------------------

This plugin can automatically deploy a release when you run "dist
release". It performs two actions for you:

    * uses "scp" to copy the released tarball to one or more hosts

    * uses "ssh" to run a deployment command on each of those hosts

Configure this behavior in your dist.ini by setting three required
arguments:

  [ScpDeploy]
  hosts      = huey, dewey, louie
  command    = release_me
  remote_dir = /home/cbarks/vault

Note well that you may specify multiple hosts by separating them with
commas and (optional) spaces.

It is your responsibility to configure "ssh" and "scp" on your machine
such that hostnames and passwordless logins work correctly *and* that
this module can find the appropriate binaries in your path. It is also
your responsibility to configure the remote hosts such that the remote
directory and the remote command to run are available.

The remote command receives one argument: the path to the release
tarball in the give remote directory.
